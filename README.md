## Introduction

[Platformus](https://github.com/Platformus/Platformus) is free, open source, and cross-platform developer-friendly CMS
based on ASP.NET Core, [ExtCore framework](https://github.com/ExtCore/ExtCore),
and [Magicalizer](https://github.com/Magicalizer/Magicalizer).

It consists of 4 extensions: Core, Website, ECommerce, and Images.

### Core

Provides such basic things like users, credentials, roles, permissions, configurations, and cultures.
Contains default extendable backend UI. Can be used as a base for the mobile application admin panels etc.

### Website

Adds the object-oriented data model (classes, members, objects, properties, and relations to create, edit,
and display content without writing code), menus, forms, and file manager. Completely enough for creating simple websites.

### ECommerce

Implements standard ecommerce features like categories, products, photos, carts, and orders in a very basic way.
Can be used as a starting point for ecommerce projects.

### Images

Provides basic image processing (cropping and resizing).
